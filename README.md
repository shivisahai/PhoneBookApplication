# PhoneBookApplication

In this project, I have created  a Phone Book where user will be able to create new Phone Book, add Person records, modify and delete them.

Purpose
The purpose of this SRS document is to present a detailed description of the Phone Book Application. It will explain the purpose and features of the application, the interfaces of the application, what the application will do, the constraints under which it must operate and how the application will react to external stimuli. This document is intended to be presented as a final project document of Software Engineering Fundamentals, National University. It will contain enough information so that a future team can use this document to create another version of the software that still fulfills all the requirements.

Scope of Project
This software application will be submitted as a final project and can be used as a Phone Book Application software. This application is designed to maximize the user’s productivity by providing features to assist in maintaining Phone Book records which would otherwise have to be maintained manually (either by memorizing or by writing somewhere). The target users of this application can be of any age group. 
More specifically, this application is designed to allow the users to create a phonebook and maintain records in it.
The goal of the software is to improve the ability to maintain phone records and reduce user’s efforts. Any inferences, conclusions, and relevant studies made based on this data will be handled independently and the software is not required to make any opinion nor is it responsible for any that are made.
